## Introduction

Copy this yaypeg if you want to start a new

- make sure `status`, `placements`, and other clauses conform to
  descriptions in `doc/CONTRACT.ini`
- update the one-line description above
- and rewrite the rest of this `README.md` to give a great
  explanation of what your plugin does
