## Introduction

This plugin is very simple in what it does. It uses system specific methods of accessing `argc` and `argv` outside of `main` and then calls
`elektraGetOpts` to do options processing.

## Limitations

- `infos/placements` should actually be between getstorage and postgetstorage. There should be a position procgetstorage that should be used
  by all plugins that only write to the `proc` namespace.
