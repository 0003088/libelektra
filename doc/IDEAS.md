# Ideas for Contributing to Elektra

This page is the first point for anyone interested in contributing to Elektra!


## GSoC 2018

This page is also the central point for students interested in contributing to Elektra during
[Google Summer of Code 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com).

Google Summer of Code is a opportunity for you to get paid while working on free software
initiatives during summer:

- [Timeline is available here.](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline)
- [Flyers can be found here.](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/media)

> Disclaimer: We do not yet know if we will participate!

### Which GSoC projects are available?

We think that GSoC is a perfect opportunity to bridge Elektra and other free
software projects. So the ideal GSoC project is to elektrify some free software.

Elektra may be used for applications (frameworks) like KDE, GNOME,
and LXCE or for any applications that need to read configuration files,
access environment variables, or command-line parameters.

Some possible tasks are:

- Integrate applications (or frameworks) into Elektra.
- Arbitrary nesting of plugins.
- Expore further ways of how configuration can be validated.
- The Qt-GUI could be improved by integrating validation.

## What are the requirements to participate?

- At least one PR submitted to Elektra (see below for details).
- Fluent in English or German
- Good writing skills in English
- Profound programming skills with focus on good code quality, documentation and unit tests.
- Ideally experience with an application (framework) or even author of a FLOSS application





## How can I get started?

We prepared
[good first issues](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/libelektra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
for you.

- We encourage you to improve documentation.
- In the source code, you should look into [libs](/src/libs/) and [plugins](/src/plugins/).
- You can always peek into the [TODOs](/doc/todo), if you don't know what to do.
- An ideal project is to elektrify some free software.

Elektrify means:

- Patch the application so that it uses Elektra as its configuration system.
- Write a specification that describes how the configuration of the application
  looks like.

If you are interested in directly improving Elektra, other projects might be of
more interest to you:

- Further configuration file formats could be supported.
- The qt-gui could be improved.
- Your own ideas?
