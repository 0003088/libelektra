## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access configuration
settings in a global, hierarchical key database.
For more information, visit [https://libelektra.org](https://libelektra.org).

## Highlights

In 8188 commits, 1698 files were changed with 89958 insertions(+) and 20191 deletions(-).

- libelektra.org: source code release of website, server managed by libelektra
- plugin+bindings for Haskell and Ruby
- improved shell completion
- new plugins: yamlcpp, camel, mini, date, file, range,
               multifile, xerces, ipaddr

### libelektra.org

Unfortunately this release is delayed. The reason for the delay is that our
community server ([build server](https://build.libelektra.org), web site,...)
was compromised and we needed to reinstall everything from scratch.

We took advantage of the situation, and reinstalled everything properly
managed by [puppet-libelektra](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/puppet-libelektra).

Thus now our community server is completely managed by Elektra.

Thanks to Bernhard Denner, for rescuing us from the difficult situation.


As already already announced in [December 2016](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/news/2016-12-17_website_release.md)
we completely reimplemented our website. Now all our sites are available via https.
This release now is the first that includes the source code of the website and its
snippet sharing functionality.

The backend for this snippet sharing website uses Elektra itself: both for its
configuration and for the configuration snippets.

Thanks again to Marvin Mall for the awesome website.

#### Haskell and Ruby

The Ruby binding already released earlier was greatly improved and now
includes libtools bindings. It is the first binding going beyond Elektra's
main API.

Many [examples](https://master.libelektra.org/src/bindings/swig/ruby/examples) for
the Ruby bindings were added.

Thanks to Bernhard Denner.


Elektra also got a new [binding](https://master.libelektra.org/src/bindings/haskell).
Elektra also added support for [plugins](https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/haskell)
to be written in Haskell. Due to generic CMake and C Code plugins can be written
exclusively in Haskell, without any glue code.

Several Haskell [examples](src/bindings/haskell/examples) already exist.
The Haskell support currently is experimental.

Thanks to Armin Wurzinger.


### Shell Completion

The new tool `kdb complete` suggests how to complete an Elektra path.
It considers mountpoints and bookmarks correctly.

Thanks to Armin Wurzinger.


The new `kdb complete` tool is used for zsh and fish bindings.

Thanks to Sebastian Bachmann and René Schwaiger.


### New Plugins

The [yamlcpp plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yaml)
and [camel plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/camel)
add first support for YAML.

The [mini plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/mini)
is yet another minimal INI plugin.

Thanks to René Schwaiger.

The [date plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/date)
supports validation of dates according to three standards:

* `RFC2822`
* `ISO8601`
* `POSIX`

The [multifile plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/multifile)
allows us to integrate many configuration files via globbing with
a single mount command. It supports `.d` configuration directories
as often used today.

The [file plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/file)
interprets the content of a file as configuration value.

The [ipaddr plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/ipaddr)
adds support for IP address validation on systems that do not
have `getaddrinfo`.

Thanks to Thomas Waser.

The [xerces plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/xerces)
supplants the [xmltool plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/xmltool)
and allows us to use XML files not following a specific schemata.
Attributes are mapped to Elektra's metadata, multiple keys with the
same names are mapped to arrays.

Thanks to Armin Wurzinger.

  a big thanks to René Schwaiger

## Features

In this release we added much more functionality, which did not make it
to the highlights.

- DBUS support for qt-gui (listening to configuration changes):
  qt-gui gets a viewer-mode where configuration settings are immediately updated
  via DBus notifications, thanks to Raffael Pancheri
- improve [curlget plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/curlget),
  is now able to upload configuration files
  thanks to Thomas Waser and Peter Nirschl (CMake fixes)
- `kdb rmmeta`, thanks to Bernhard Denner
- [fcrypt plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/fcrypt):
  major improvements and output list available GPG keys when config is missing,
  thanks to Peter Nirschl
- Thomas Waser added useful scripts:
  - [mount-list-all-files](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-mount-list-all-files.md)
    to list all mounted files.
  - [mountpoint-info](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-mountpoint-info.md)
    to give more info about mountpoints.
  - [stash](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-stash.md)
    to stash away Elektra's configuration, to be restored using `restore`.
  - [backup](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-backup.md)
    to backup Elektra's configuration.
  - [restore](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-restore.md)
    to restore a backup or stash.
  - [check-env-dep](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-check-env-dep.md)
    allows users to check if environment has influence on configuration settings.
  - [change-resolver](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-change-resolver.md)
    allows users to change the default resolver.
  - [change-storage](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-change-storage.md)
    allows users to change the default storage.
- limit min/max depth for `kdb ls` (`-mM`), thanks to Armin Wurzinger.
- conditionals: allow multiple assigns and conditions
- jna bindings: greatly improved, now uses maven+doxygen
  thanks to Armin Wurzinger
- base64 also works as filter for binary data (not just encrypted data),
  thanks to René Schwaiger
- [csvstorage plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/csvstorage):
  compatibility with RFC 4180, thanks to Thomas Waser
- [gitresolver plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/gitresolver):
  improvements and update libgit version, thanks to Thomas Waser
- [curlget plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/curlget):
  also allow uploading of configuration files, thanks to Thomas Waser

## Compatibility

As always, the ABI and API of kdb.h is fully compatible, i.e. programs
compiled against an older 0.8 version of Elektra will continue to work
(ABI) and you will be able to recompile programs without errors (API).

We added `explicit` to some C++ constructors in libtools and internally moved
some typedefs. ModulesPluginDatabase now has protected members (instead
of private). This might break weird code, but should not affect binary
compatibility.

- scripts now work on macOS (readlink and sed),
  thanks to Armin Wurzinger and René Schwaiger
- generalized error #60, "invalid line encountered"
- added new errors #164 - #187
- added private headerfiles `kdbglobal.h`, `kdbinvoke.h`

TODO check:
- did fcrypt config parameter change?
- new installed files?
- INI meta, line continuation now tab?

## Notes for Maintainer

- LICENSE.md now contains only the BSD 3-Clause License
  (without any additional non-license text)
- AUTHORS renamed to AUTHORS.md
- NEWS.md is now a generated file containing all news concatenated
- CMake 2.8.8 is no longer supported, CMake 3.0 is now needed
- fix macOS RPATH, remove old policies, thanks to René Schwaiger
- new option BUILD_DOCSET to build DocSet, thanks to René Schwaiger
- new option ENABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS for OPMPHM preparation work, thanks to Kurt Micheli
  For this release, please keep ENABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS turned off.
  Currently the flag increases memory usage, without being faster.
- add TARGET_TOOL_DATA_FOLDER for installation of tool data (for rest-backend and rest-frontend)

Following files were removed:

- test_opmphm_vheap
- test_opmphm_vstack

Following files were renamed:

- libelektra-1.jar -> libelektra4j-0.8.19.jar

 - ELEKTRA_STRINGIFY to quote a macro value
