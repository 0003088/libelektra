## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access configuration
settings in a global, hierarchical key database.
For more information, visit [https://libelektra.org](https://libelektra.org).

## Highlights

In 8188 commits, 1698 files were changed with 89958 insertions(+) and 20191 deletions(-).

- libelektra.org: source code release of website, server managed by libelektra
- plugin+bindings for Haskell and Ruby
- improved shell completion
- new plugins: yamlcpp, camel, mini, date, file, range,
               multifile, xerces, ipaddr

### libelektra.org

Unfortunately this release is delayed. The reason for the delay is that our
community server ([build server](https://build.libelektra.org), web site,...)
was compromised and we needed to reinstall everything from scratch.

We took advantage of the situation, and reinstalled everything properly
managed by [puppet-libelektra](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/puppet-libelektra).

Thus now our community server is completely managed by Elektra.

Thanks to Bernhard Denner, for rescuing us from the difficult situation.


As already already announced in [December 2016](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/news/2016-12-17_website_release.md)
we completely reimplemented our website. Now all our sites are available via https.
This release is the first one that includes the source code of the website and its
snippet sharing functionality.

The backend for this snippet sharing website uses Elektra itself: both for its
configuration and for the configuration snippets.

Thanks again to Marvin Mall for the awesome website.

#### Haskell and Ruby

The Ruby binding, created by Bernhard Denner, was greatly improved and now
includes libtools bindings. It is the first binding that goes beyond Elektra's
main API. Bernhard Denner also added many
[examples](https://master.libelektra.org/src/bindings/swig/ruby/examples) that
demonstrate how you can take advantage of the Ruby bindings.

Armin Wurzinger created a new [binding](https://master.libelektra.org/src/bindings/haskell)
for the functional language Haskell. He also added support for
[Haskell plugins](https://master.libelektra.org/src/plugins/haskell).
Due to generic CMake and C Code plugins can be written
exclusively in Haskell, without any glue code. Several Haskell [examples](/src/bindings/haskell/examples) already exist.
The Haskell support is currently experimental.

### Shell Completion

René Schwaiger added completion support for [Fish](http://fishshell.com) in this release.
We also extended our support for other shells: The new tool `kdb complete` suggests
how to complete an Elektra path. It considers mountpoints and also takes bookmarks into account.
Thanks to Armin Wurzinger for creating this useful utility. Our Zsh and fish completions
already take advantage of `kdb complete`. Thanks to Sebastian Bachmann for
taking the time to update the `zsh` completions.

### New Plugins

The [yamlcpp plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/yaml)
and [camel plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/camel)
add first support for YAML.

The [mini plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/mini)
is yet another minimal INI plugin.

Thanks to René Schwaiger.

The [date plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/date)
supports validation of dates according to three standards:

* `RFC2822`
* `ISO8601`
* `POSIX`

The [multifile plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/multifile)
allows us to integrate many configuration files via globbing with
a single mount command. It supports `.d` configuration directories
as often used today.

The [file plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/file)
interprets the content of a file as configuration value.

The [ipaddr plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/ipaddr)
adds support for IP address validation on systems that do not
support `getaddrinfo`.

Thanks to Thomas Waser for creating these useful plugins.

The [xerces plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/xerces)
supplants the [xmltool plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/xmltool)
and allows us to use XML files not following a specific schemata.
Attributes are mapped to Elektra's metadata, multiple keys with the
same names are mapped to arrays.

Thanks to Armin Wurzinger.

    to list all mounted files.
  - [mountpoint-info](https://master.libelektra.org/doc/help/kdb-mountpoint-info.md)

## Compatibility

As always, the ABI and API of kdb.h is fully compatible, i.e. programs
compiled against an older 0.8 version of Elektra will continue to work
(ABI) and you will be able to recompile programs without errors (API).

We added `explicit` to some C++ constructors in libtools and internally moved
some typedefs. ModulesPluginDatabase now has protected members (instead
of private). This might break weird code, but should not affect binary
compatibility.

- scripts now work on macOS (readlink and sed),
  thanks to Armin Wurzinger and René Schwaiger
- generalized error #60, "invalid line encountered"
- added new errors #164 - #187
- added private headerfiles `kdbglobal.h`, `kdbinvoke.h`

## Notes for Maintainer

- LICENSE.md now contains only the BSD 3-Clause License
  (without any additional non-license text)
- AUTHORS renamed to AUTHORS.md
- NEWS.md is now a generated file containing all news concatenated
- CMake 2.8.8 is no longer supported, CMake 3.0 is now needed
- fix macOS `RPATH`, remove old policies, thanks to René Schwaiger
- new option `BUILD_DOCSET` to build DocSet, thanks to René Schwaiger
- new option `ENABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS` for `OPMPHM` preparation work, thanks to Kurt Micheli
  For this release, please keep `ENABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS` turned off.
  Currently the flag increases memory usage, without being faster.

## Outlook

We are currently working on following topics:

- Migration of LCDproc, OpenIcc, machinekit, ... to Elektra.
- A reimplementation of Elektra's core API in Rust (next to implementation in C).
- A user interface which generates restricted input fields based on the specification.
- YAML as configuration file format (next to INI, XML, JSON, TCL, ...).
- An mmap persistent cache.
- Improvements for the specification language.
- New APIs to be directly used by applications.
- An order-preserving minimal hash for O(1) lookup and iteration.
- Mainloop migration for notifications (currently only DBus, to be extended to Redis, ZeroMq).
- Improvements on the Website and snippet sharing to also handle misconfiguration.
