### <<ONE POINT PER HIGHLIGHT>> (TODO, not yet done)

### libelektra.org

Unfortunately this release is delayed.  The reason for this is, that
our community server was compromised and we needed to reinstall everything
from scratch.

We took advantage of the situation, and reinstalled everything properly
managed by [puppet-libelektra](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/puppet-libelektra).

Thanks to Bernhard Denner, for rescuing us from the difficult situation.

TODO, not yet written

All our pages are now available via https.

  (was already announced earlier, but this is the first time
   that a release of Elektra includes the source code of
   the website)

The backend uses Elektra itself.

Thanks to Marvin Mall for the new website.

#### Haskell and Ruby

Ruby includes libtools bindings.

### Shell Completion

The new tool `kdb complete` suggests how to complete an Elektra path.
It considers mountpoints and bookmarks correctly.

Thanks to Armin Wurzinger.

The new `kdb complete` tool is now used for zsh and fish bindings.

Thanks to Sebastian Bachmann and René Schwaiger.

### New Plugins

TODO: file, range, ipaddr, yamlcpp, camel, mini

The date plugin supports validation of dates according to three standards:

* `RFC2822`
* `ISO8601`
* `POSIX`

The [multifile plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/multifile)
allows us to integrate many configuration files via globbing with
a single mount command. It supports `.d` configuration directories
as often used today.

The [xerces plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/xerces)
supplants the [xmltool plugin](https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/xmltool)
and allows us to use XML files not following a specific schemata.
Attributes are mapped to Elektra's metadata, multiple keys with the
same names are mapped to arrays.
