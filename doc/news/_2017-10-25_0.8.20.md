## What is Elektra?

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access configuration
parameters in a global, hierarchical key database.

## Highlights

- new plugins: yamlcpp, date, file, range
- libelektra.org: new website+managed by libelektra
- plugin+bindings for Haskell and Ruby
- improved shell completion

### <<ONE POINT PER HIGHLIGHT>> (TODO, not yet done)

### new plugins

TODO: file, range, yamlcpp

The date plugin supports validation of dates according to three standards:

* `RFC2822`
* `ISO8601`
* `POSIX`

### libelektra.org

Unfortunately this release is delayed.  The reason for this is, that
someone hacked our community server and we needed to reinstall everything
from scratch.

We took advantage of the situation, and reinstalled everything properly
manged by [puppet-libelektra](https://github.com/ElektraInitiative/puppet-libelektra).

Thanks to Bernhard Denner, for rescuing us from the difficult situation.

TODO, not yet written

All our pages are now available via https.

  (was already announced earlier, but this is the first time
   that a release of Elektra includes the source code of
   the website)

The backend uses Elektra itself.

Thanks to Marvin Mall for the new website.

#### Haskell and Ruby

Ruby includes libtools bindings.

### Shell Completion

The new tool `kdb complete` suggests how to complete an Elektra path.
It considers mountpoints and bookmarks correctly.

Thanks to Armin Wurzinger.

The new `kdb complete` tool is now used for zsh and fish bindings.

Thanks to Sebastian Bachmann and René Schwaiger.
